1. What challenges did you face during the project?
One major challenge was getting dynamic DOM updates to work correctly, especially when adding and removing products while keeping the total price accurate. Managing event listeners for newly created elements was challenging as well.

2. How did you approach solving those challenges?
I used the createElement and appendChild methods to build elements dynamically and attached event listeners directly after creating them. I also broke the logic into smaller functions to isolate and test each part separately. This made it easier to fix errors step by step.

3. What would you improve if given more time?
If I had more time, I would improve styling and add a confirmation messageS before deleting products.
